## RF remapping with gain modulation

## System requirements

+ python

+ python packages (matplotlib, spicy)

## Installation guide

   Installation is not needed.

## Demo/Instructions for use

(1) activation_func_fitting.py is used to fitting the parameters of a memristive neuron's
    activation function.
    
(2) networkk.py is used to simulate the RF expansion with a one-dimensional neural 
    network with memristive neurons.
